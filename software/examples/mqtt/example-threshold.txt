# Change XYZ to the UID of your Voltage Bricklet

setup:
	# Get threshold callbacks with a debounce time of 10 seconds (10000ms)
	publish '{"debounce": 10000}' to tinkerforge/request/voltage_bricklet/XYZ/set_debounce_period

	# Handle incoming voltage reached callbacks
	subscribe to tinkerforge/callback/voltage_bricklet/XYZ/voltage_reached
	publish '{"register": true}' to tinkerforge/register/voltage_bricklet/XYZ/voltage_reached # Register voltage_reached callback

	# Configure threshold for voltage "greater than 5 V"
	publish '{"option": "greater", "min": 5000, "max": 0}' to tinkerforge/request/voltage_bricklet/XYZ/set_voltage_callback_threshold
